    <h1>Week 04 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) in JavaScript</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It simply means separating the code into objects that have properties and
      methods. The objects can be reused or easily modified, as required. The
      three pillars of OOP's are: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The inner workings that are kept hidden
      inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to
      the user. For example, in our IDE we print to the console and it prints
      the result to us, we don't know what is happening behind the hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The same process that can be used for
      different objects. Objects can share the same method, but also have the
      ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Inheritance: </strong> We can taje an object that already exists
      and inherit all its properties and methods. Then we can improve on its
      functionality by adding new properties and methods
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript contains a number of built-in constructor such as Object, Array
      and Function
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>ES6 Class Declaration</h2>
    <p>
      class Dice {<br />
      constructor(sides=6) {<br />
      this.sides = sides;<br />
      }<br />
      roll() {<br />
      return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)<br />
      }<br />
      }<br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <strong>Static Method: </strong>The stati keyword can be used in class
      declartion to create a static method.
    </p>
    <p>
      class Dice { <br />
      constructor(sides=6) {<br />
      this.sides = sides;<br />
      } <br />
      roll() { <br />
      return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1) <br />
      } <br />
      static description() { <br />
      return 'A way of choosing random numbers' <br />
      } <br />
      }
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Prototypal Inheritance</h2>
    <p>
      - JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model which means that every
      class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the
      class. So any properties or methods of a class prototype can be accessed
      by every object instantiated by that class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>class </span>Turtle { <br />
      constructor(name) { <br />
      this.name = name; <br />
      this.weapon = 'hands'; <br />
      } <br />
      sayHi() { <br />
      return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`; <br />
      } attack(){ <br />
      return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`; } <br />
      } <br />
      <br />
      const leo = new Turtle('Leonardo'); <br />
      << Turtle { name: 'Leonardo' } br
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prtotpye Property: </strong> It help us to add methods and
      properties to the class even if we don't have access to the class
      declartion
    </p>
    <p>
      Turtle.prototype.weapon = 'Hands'; <br />
      << 'Hands' <br />
      <br />
      The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the
      class has been declared
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Publice and Private Methods</h2>
    <p>
      By default, an objects methods are public in JavaScript. In the example
      below Turtle Class has been modified to include a private color property
    </p>
    <p>
      class Turtle { <br />
      constructor(name,color) { <br />
      this.name = name; <br />
      let _color = color; <br />
      this.setColor = color => { return _color = color; } <br />
      this.getColor = () => _color;<br />
      } <br />
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enumerable Properties: </strong> Properites of objects in
      JavaScript are said to be enumerable or non-enumerable. If they are not
      that means they will not show up when for-in loops is used to loop through
      an objects properties and methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Inheritance Using Extends: </strong>A class can inherit from
      another class using extends keyword in a class declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      class Turtle { <br />
      constructor(name) { <br />
      this.name = name; <br />
      } <br />
      sayHi() { <br />
      return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`; <br />
      } <br />
      swim() { <br />
      return `${this.name} paddles in the water`; <br />
      } <br />
      } <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      class NinjaTurtle extends Turtle { <br />
      constructor(name) { <br />
      super(name); <br />
      this.weapon = 'hands'; <br />
      } <br />
      attack() { return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!` } <br />
      } <br />
      <br />
      Super refers to the parent class, and can be used to access any properties
      and call any methods of the parent class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Polymorphism: </strong> The concept of polymorphism means that
      different object can have the same method, but implement in different
      ways.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Forms are made up of a element that contains form controls such as input
      fields, select menus and buttons. These fields can be populated with the
      information that is processed once the form has been submitted. <br />
      Document.Forms returns an HTML collectin of all the forms in the document
      in the ordery they appear in the markup.
      <br /><br />
      const form = document.forms[0];
    </p>
    <p>
      A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML
      collection of all the elements contained in the form. <br />
      const [input,button] = form.elements; <br />
      <br />
      The most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form
      is submitted. Usually, this will send the content of the form to the
      server to be processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Form Validation: </strong>A process of checking whether a user has
      entered the information into a form correctly. Example: A required field,
      an email address is valid, a number is entered, password is at least a
      minimum number of characters. <br /><br />
      form.addEventListener('submit',validate,false);<br />
      function validate(event) { <br />
      const firstLetter = form.heroName.value[0]; <br />
      if (firstLetter.toUpperCase() === 'X') { <br />
      event.preventDefault(); <br />
      alert('Your name is not allowed to start with X!'); <br />
      } <br />
      }
    </p>
